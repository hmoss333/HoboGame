# Use Method 1: Install Unity Hub via terminal (for Ubuntu and Debian)

This is the recommended way of installing Unity Hub on the supported devices, that is Ubuntu and CentOS.
This method will work only in Ubuntu 20.04, 19.04, and CentOS 7. If you are running any of these, letâ€™s jump right in.

Open a terminal and enter the commands one after another:

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/repos/deb stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unityhub.list'
wget -qO - https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/keys/public | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install unityhub
```

This will install Unity Hub to your system.

You now need to sign in with your Unity account. Clicking the sign-in button will open a browser tab and you need to allow the link to open in Unity Hub app

Now, you will need to choose license Personal, if you do not have a paid plan, from the next screen

Finally, On the next screen, you will be asked to download an editor to work with projects. It normally takes several GBs of download. So sit back and relax while the download completes.
